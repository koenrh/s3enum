# s3enum

s3enum is a tool to enumerate a target's Amazon S3 buckets. It is fast and leverages
DNS instead of HTTP, which means that requests don't hit AWS directly.

It was originally built back in 2016 to [target GitHub](https://koen.io/2016/02/13/github-bug-bounty-hunting/).

## Installation

### Binaries

Find the binaries on the [Releases page](https://github.com/koenrh/s3enum/releases).

### Go

```console
go get github.com/koenrh/s3enum
```

## Usage

You need to specify the base name of the target (e.g., `hackerone`), and a word list.
You could either use the example [`wordlist.txt`](examples/wordlist.txt) file from
this repository, or get a word list [elsewhere](https://github.com/bitquark/dnspop/tree/master/results).
Optionally, you could specify the number of threads (defaults to 10).

```
$ s3enum -wordlist examples/wordlist.txt -suffixlist examples/suffixlist.txt -threads 10 hackerone

hackerone
hackerone-attachment
hackerone-attachments
hackerone-static
hackerone-upload
```

By default, `s3enum` will use the name server as specified in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
Alternatively, you could specify a different name server using the `-nameserver`
option. Besides, you could test multiple names at the same time.

```
s3enum \
  -wordlist examples/wordlist.txt \
  -suffixlist examples/suffixlist.txt \
  -nameserver 1.1.1.1 \
  hackerone h1 roflcopter
```
